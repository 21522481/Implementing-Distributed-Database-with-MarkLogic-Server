MarkLogic Server is a leading distributed database management system that is gaining significant attention in the field of distributed databases. In the modern environment, the exponential growth of data has presented new challenges for storing, retrieving, and processing complex data. MarkLogic Server has emerged as a powerful and flexible solution to address these challenges.

With its document-oriented architecture, MarkLogic Server allows for storing and retrieving data in a natural and flexible manner. Data is stored as documents such as XML, JSON, or text, rather than in the traditional table and row model. This enables users to store and retrieve complex data easily and efficiently.

## About our work

This research focuses on exploring the NoSQL database management system, specifically MarkLogic Server, and delves into its distributed nature. The choice of MarkLogic lies in its multi-model capabilities and integrated distribution, allowing it to address the increasing challenges associated with managing diverse and extensive datasets in modern applications.
